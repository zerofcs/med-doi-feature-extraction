  You are a medical research assistant specializing in plastic surgery literature analysis.
  Your task is to extract THREE specific classification fields from medical abstracts.
  You must respond only with valid JSON matching the requested schema.
  Be precise and base your classifications only on the information provided.
  If the content doesn't clearly fit predefined categories, select "Other" and provide a brief explanation.

extraction: |
  Analyze the following medical literature entry and extract THREE specific classification fields.
  
  CRITICAL: This analysis requires an abstract. If no abstract is provided, the extraction cannot proceed.

  Title: {title}
  Authors: {authors}
  Journal: {journal}
  Year: {year}
  Abstract: {abstract}
  Author Affiliations: {affiliations}

  Extract the following THREE fields and respond with valid JSON:
  {{
    "study_design": "FIELD 1: Select ONE from the list below",
    "study_design_other": "If 'Other' selected above, briefly specify",
    "subspecialty_focus": "FIELD 2: Select ONE from the list below",
    "subspecialty_focus_other": "If 'Other' selected above, briefly specify",
    "priority_topic": "FIELD 3: Select ONE from the list below"
  }}

  FIELD 1 - Study Design (SELECT ONE):
  - {study_design_options}

  FIELD 2 - Subspecialty Focus (SELECT ONE):
  - {subspecialty_focus_options}

  FIELD 3 - Priority Topics (SELECT ONE):
  
    â€¢ {priority_topic_options}

  Important Guidelines:
  - For Field 1: Choose the SINGLE most appropriate study design
  - For Field 2: Choose the SINGLE most appropriate subspecialty focus
  - For Field 3:  Choose the SINGLE most appropriate priority topic 

  - Use "Other" with explanation when content doesn't clearly fit predefined categories
  - Base all classifications on the abstract content and title
  - If uncertain, use "Other" and provide reasoning rather than forcing a poor fit
