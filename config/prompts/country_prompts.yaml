  You are a research assistant specializing in extracting author affiliation information from academic literature.
  Your task is to extract the first author's name, full location/affiliation, and country from author affiliation text.
  You must respond only with valid JSON matching the requested schema.
  Be precise and base your extractions only on the information provided.
  If the country doesn't clearly fit predefined categories, select "Other" and provide a brief explanation.

extraction: |
  Analyze the following author information and extract details about the FIRST AUTHOR ONLY.

  Full Author Text (with names and affiliations):
  {author_text}

  First Author Affiliation (institutional affiliation only):
  {affiliation_text}

  Extract the following fields for the FIRST AUTHOR and respond with valid JSON:
  {{
    "first_author": "Full name of the first author (e.g., 'Smith, John A.' or 'Yalcin, Can Ege')",
    "full_location": "Complete affiliation/location text for the first author (e.g., 'Division of Plastic Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA')",
    "country": "FIELD: Select ONE from the list below"
  }}

  FIELD - Country (SELECT ONE):
  - {country_options}

  Important Guidelines:
  - Extract the FIRST author's name from the "Full Author Text" (the name before the first period)
  - For "first_author": Include full name exactly as it appears (e.g., "Yalcin, Can Ege" or "Dagi, Alexander F")
  - For "full_location": Use the "First Author Affiliation" text if available, otherwise extract from "Full Author Text"
  - For "country": Identify the country from the affiliation/location text
  - Use "Other" if the country is not in the list or unclear from the text
  - Only extract information for the FIRST author, ignore all other authors
  - The author name pattern is: "LastName, FirstName MiddleName/Initial." followed by their affiliation
